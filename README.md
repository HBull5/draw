# Draw API

## Implementation

-   Add an HTML `<canvas>` element somewhere on the desired page
-   Include `draw.js` on the desired page

## Gotchas

-   You can only draw on the canvas so make sure its the appropriate size w/ CSS

## Bugs

-   Canvas does not dynamically resize on browser adjustment
